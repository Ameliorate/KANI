    <p>
    The Knot And Nexus Interchange (previously known as Nexus International Gateway) is a system of rails and rail switches centered around Nexus that was created with the goal of fully afk travel across the map, that will always route you to the correct destination.
    It was designed to be easilly added to with little colaboration between nations.

    <p>
    Rail systems that predate the KANI were often buggy, being unable to route players to some destinations.
    They were also difficult to add to, having to update many destination signs to just add one destination.
    In addition, since the creation of the KANI they often don't act properly, sending players in circles, to the incorrect stop, or sending them back to where they came.
