The IceniaTransitSystem is the intercity RailSwitch network in IceniaCity.

It has many destinations within the city, including multiple stations within the downtown, the factory building, and versailles.

TECHNICAL INFO
--------------

The IceniaTrransitSystem is built as a giant one-way loop going around IceniaCity. Each station is a single two-way rail. Thus, the IceniaTransitSystem has a star topology. A layout like this minimizes costs at the expense of a minimal chance of collisions. However, because of this one-way layout, it can sometimes be faster to walk to a nearby station that is "behind you" on the topology.
